<div class="usertext-body may-blank-within md-container "><div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/35q6cs/wp_you_sold_your_soul_to_the_devil_some_years_ago/cr6s0h6"><strong>Prompt: You sold your soul to the Devil some years ago. Today he gives it back and says, "I need a favor."</strong></a></p>

<p>His voice is difficult to describe.</p>

<p>Picture this: your eardrum is a cigarette filter and his mouth is the burning sunspot of the lit end.</p>

<p>Whenever he speaks, it’s like your brain’s taking a long, long drag.</p>

<p><em>”Remember that little deal we had a while back?”</em></p>

<p>Deal? More like ‘scam’. “The deal we made when I was just a kid? <em>Yeah,</em> I remember that deal.”</p>

<p><em>”Whoa, now,”</em> he said. <em>”I’m detecting a little bit of acid in your speech, there. You angry about something?”</em></p>

<p>“You made a deal with an eight year-old, you colossal douchebag. I wanted to be a ‘space cowboy’, and you took my soul over that?” I shook my head. “What the hell, man?”</p>

<p><em>“Right. About that...”</em> He smiled and it was like watching a crack form in the glacial north arctic. Every time he did it you just knew that some polar bear was getting his life screwed over. <em>“Turns out,”</em> he said, with that same smile, <em>“that your little eight year-old fantasy may not be so useless after all.”</em></p>

<p>I turned around and started locking up the drawers. I was closing up the coffee shop tonight. “Get to the point, Devil.”</p>

<p>His eyes glimmered with some inner light. <em>“Well, I have a particularly difficult task I need your expertise with. I need some space cowboying done.”</em></p>

<p>“You’re shitting me.”</p>
